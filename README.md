# Commit Hawk ðŸ¦…

### WHY?

Watching a repository on GitHub tells you about social activity (e.g. PRs, issues, etc.), but it doesn't notify you about file-level changes that you and your team might care about. 

For example, when an external vendor merges in their work, or when a critical part of the codebase is changed, or when new dependencies are added, etc 

Commit Hawk fills that gap. 

### INSTALLATION

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy">

</a>

1. Deploy this project to Heroku or your platform of choice. 
2. Creat a Slack Webhook. Add the webhook URL to this deployment's environment variables as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Add this deployment URL as a webhook in the GitHub repository you want to track. 
4. That's it! When the files you are watching change, you will get a Slack notification.
